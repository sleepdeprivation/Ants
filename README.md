# Ants
an ant simulator


A cute little ant simulator!
The ants lay down "paths" and these paths are managed by the PathManager.
The ants are managed by the simulator class.
A lot of stuff is packed into script.js. I think it may be time to break it up though.

The way the ants move and the way scent trails are managed changes very frequently...

To do:
  Manage stuff better!
  Decide how ants should move
  
This thing was supposed to be a little sketch for something in a more powerful language. So much for that...
I don't want to rewrite it. (Not that I have the time as of this writing)
